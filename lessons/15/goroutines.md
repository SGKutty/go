title: 16 - Goroutines
---
***

âž© **Goroutines** are functions that are created and scheduled to be run independently by the Go scheduler. The Go scheduler is responsible for the management and execution of goroutines.

- Goroutines are functions that are scheduled to run independently.

- We must always maintain an account of running goroutines and shutdown cleanly.

- Concurrency is not parallelism ([blog](https://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism)).

  - **Concurrency** is about dealing with lots of things at once.

  - **Parallelism** is about doing lots of things at once.
