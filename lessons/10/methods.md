title: 10 - Methods

***

➩ __Methods__ are functions that are declared with a receiver which binds the method to a type. Methods can be used to operate on values or pointers of that type.

➩ Methods are valid when it is practical or reasonable for a piece of data to expose a capability

* Methods are functions that declare a receiver variable.

* Receivers bind a method to a type and can use value or pointer semantics.

* Value semantics mean a copy of the value is passed across program boundaries.

* Pointer semantics mean a copy of the values address is passed across program boundaries.

* Stick to a single semantic for a given type and be consistent.
