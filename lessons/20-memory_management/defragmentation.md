- __Defragmentation__ is the process of locating the noncontiguous fragments of data into which a computer file may be divided as it is stored on a hard disk, and rearranging the fragments and storing them into fewer fragments or into the whole file.

- Defragmentation reduces data access time and allows storage to be used more efficently.
