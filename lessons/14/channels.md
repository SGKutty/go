***

➩ **Channels** allow goroutines to communicate with each other through the use of signaling semantics.

➩ Channels accomplish this signaling through the use of sending/receiving data or by identifying state changes on individual channels.

➩ Don't architect software with the idea of channels being a queue, focus on signaling and the semantics that simplify the orchestration required.
