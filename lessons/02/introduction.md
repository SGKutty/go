title: 02 - Why a new language
---
***

During the development of **Golang**, the major languages on ground are `Java`, `Python` and `C/C++`

&nbsp;

## The Problems related to these languages
***

- **Java** have Increasingly complex type system.

- **Python** is easy to use, but slow(interpreted language).

- **C/C++** have complex type system, also slow compile times.

- When concurrency come to display all above languages getting down.

- Concurrency is different than parallelism([blog](https://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism)).

- Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at onceâ€Š- `Rob Pike`.

## Features of Golang
***

- Strong and statically typed.

- Has Excellent community.

- Key features:

  - Simplicity.

  - Fast compile time.

  - Garbage collected.

  - Build in concurrency.

  - Compile to standalone binaries.
