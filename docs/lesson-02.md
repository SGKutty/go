* Java
* Python
* C/C++

## The Problems related to these languages

***

* __Java__ have Increasingly complex type system.

* __Python__ is easy to use, but slow(interpreted language).

* __C/C++__ have complex type system, also slow compile times.

* When `Concurrency` come to display all above languages getting down.

* Concurrency is [different](https://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism) than parallelism.

* Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at onceâ€Š- Rob Pike
